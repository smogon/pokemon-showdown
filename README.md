Introduction

Pokémon Showdown is many things:

- A **web site** you can use for Pokémon battling

  - http://pokemonshowdown.com/

- A **JavaScript library** for simulating Pokémon battles and getting Pokédex data

  - https://github.com/smogon/pokemon-showdown/blob/master/sim/README.md

- Some **command-line tools** for simulating Pokémon battles (which can be used in non-JavaScript programs)

  - https://github.com/smogon/pokemon-showdown/blob/master/COMMANDLINE.md

- A **game server** for hosting your own Pokémon Showdown community and game modes

  - https://github.com/smogon/pokemon-showdown/blob/master/server/README.md

Pokémon Showdown simulates singles, doubles and triples battles in all the games out so far (Generations 1 through 8).
