## 🎨 Custom Animations System

This PR introduces a simplified custom animations system that allows users to apply visual effects to their usernames in both the userlist and chat messages.

### ✨ Features

**8 Predefined Animations:**
- `pulse` - Gentle pulsing effect (`pulse 2s infinite`)
- `bounce` - Bouncing effect (`bounce 1s infinite`)
- `glow` - Glowing effect (`glow 2s infinite`)
- `shake` - Shaking effect (`shake 0.5s infinite`)
- `rotate` - Rotating effect (`rotate 3s infinite linear`)
- `fade` - Fading effect (`fade 2s infinite`)
- `slide` - Sliding effect (`slide 2s infinite`)
- `rainbow` - Rainbow color cycling (`rainbow 3s infinite linear`)

### 🎯 Key Design Decisions

**Simplified Approach:**
- No complex animation options (duration, delay, iteration, etc.)
- Fixed, optimized animation settings for each type
- Clean CSS generation: `[id$="-userlist-user-${userid}"] { animation: pulse 2s infinite; }`
- Easy-to-use commands: `/animation set user, pulse`

### 🔧 Technical Implementation

**Database:**
- Simple schema: `{ _id: userid, animation: string, createdAt: Date, updatedAt: Date }`
- Uses ImpulseDB for MongoDB integration

**CSS Generation:**
- Generates keyframe definitions for all animations
- Applies user-specific animations to both userlist and chat messages
- Updates `config/custom.css` with proper selectors

**Commands:**
- `/animation set [user], [animation]` - Set animation
- `/animation update [user], [animation]` - Update animation
- `/animation delete [user]` - Remove animation
- `/animation list [page]` - List all animations
- `/animation view [user]` - View user's animation
- `/animation preview [animation]` - Preview effect
- `/animation available` - List available animations
- `/animation search [term]` - Search by username
- `/animation count` - Show total count
- `/animation logs [number]` - View logs

### 🎁 Reward System Integration

**Level 30+ Reward:**
- Added `customanimation` to the reward system
- Users can request animations via `/exp request customanimation [animation]`
- Full staff approval/rejection workflow
- Visual previews in pending requests

**Validation:**
- Ensures only valid animation names are accepted
- Prevents duplicate animations per user
- Proper error handling and user feedback

### 📊 Staff Management

**Complete Moderation Tools:**
- Set, update, delete animations
- View all animations with pagination
- Search by username
- Comprehensive logging system
- Staff room notifications

**Logging:**
- All actions logged to `logs/customanimations.txt`
- Timestamp, staff member, target user, and details
- Viewable via `/animation logs` command

### 🎨 User Experience

**Visual Feedback:**
- Live animation previews in staff interface
- User notifications when animations are set/updated/removed
- Clean, intuitive command structure
- Help system with all available animations

**Performance:**
- Efficient CSS generation
- Minimal database queries
- Optimized animation keyframes
- Fast page loads with pagination

### 🔄 Integration Points

**Existing Systems:**
- Integrates with existing reward system
- Uses same logging patterns as other customizations
- Follows established staff command structure
- Compatible with existing CSS framework

### 📝 Files Changed

- `impulse/chat-plugins/customanimations.ts` - New animation system
- `impulse/chat-plugins/exp-system.ts` - Added customanimation reward
- `impulse/chat-plugins/customization-analysis-extended.md` - Documentation

### 🧪 Testing

**Manual Testing:**
- All 8 animations work correctly
- CSS generation produces expected output
- Commands handle edge cases properly
- Reward system integration functions correctly
- Staff management tools work as expected

### 🚀 Usage Examples

```bash
# Staff commands
/animation set username, pulse
/animation update username, bounce
/animation delete username
/animation preview glow

# User reward
/exp request customanimation rainbow
```

### 📈 Future Enhancements

The system is designed to be easily extensible:
- Add new animation types by updating `PREDEFINED_ANIMATIONS`
- Maintain simple CSS generation approach
- Keep user-friendly command structure

This implementation provides a solid foundation for user customization while maintaining simplicity and performance.
