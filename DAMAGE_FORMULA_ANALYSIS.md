# Damage Formula and Rounding Analysis: rpg-wip vs pokemon-showdown

## Executive Summary

This document analyzes the accuracy of the damage formula and rounding implementations in the `rpg-wip` battle simulator compared to the official `pokemon-showdown` simulator and the actual Pokémon games.

**Overall Assessment**: The rpg-wip implementation is **fundamentally accurate** for normal gameplay. The core damage formula matches the games exactly, and most modifiers are correctly implemented. Minor differences exist in modifier precision and application order, but these typically result in at most 1-2 damage point differences in edge cases.

## Key Findings

### 1. Core Damage Formula

#### Pokemon-Showdown (Official):
```typescript
// Location: sim/battle-actions.ts, line 1716
const baseDamage = tr(tr(tr(tr(2 * level / 5 + 2) * basePower * attack) / defense) / 50);
// Then +2 is added in modifyDamage
baseDamage += 2;
```

#### RPG-WIP Implementation:
```typescript
// Location: impulse/chat-plugins/rpg-wip/battle-core.ts, lines 779-783
const levelFactor = Math.floor((2 * attacker.level) / 5 + 2);
let baseDamage = Math.floor((levelFactor * basePower * finalAttackStat) / defenseStat);
baseDamage = Math.floor(baseDamage / 50);
baseDamage += 2;
```

**Analysis**: ✅ **ACCURATE** - Both implementations follow the standard damage formula:
```
((2 × Level / 5 + 2) × Power × Attack / Defense / 50) + 2
```

### 2. Truncation/Rounding Methods

#### Pokemon-Showdown:
Uses `trunc` function for unsigned 32-bit integer truncation:
```typescript
// Location: sim/dex.ts, lines 361-364
trunc(this: void, num: number, bits = 0) {
    if (bits) return (num >>> 0) % (2 ** bits);
    return num >>> 0;
}
```

This uses bitwise unsigned right shift (`>>> 0`) which effectively truncates (floors toward zero for positive numbers).

#### RPG-WIP:
Uses `Math.floor` and a custom `pokeRound` function:
```typescript
// Location: impulse/chat-plugins/rpg-wip/battle-core.ts, lines 49-51
function pokeRound(num: number): number {
    return (num % 1 > 0.5) ? Math.ceil(num) : Math.floor(num);
}
```

**Analysis**: ⚠️ **PARTIALLY DIFFERENT**
- `Math.floor` is used for most calculations in rpg-wip, which matches the behavior of `trunc` for positive numbers
- The `pokeRound` function rounds 0.5 down (floor), which is correct for Gen 5+ games
- However, Pokemon-Showdown uses a different approach for modifier application (see below)

### 3. Modifier Application Order

#### Pokemon-Showdown:
Uses the `modify` function with 4096-based arithmetic for precise modifier handling:
```typescript
// Location: sim/battle.ts, lines 2302-2313
modify(value: number, numerator: number | number[], denominator = 1) {
    const tr = this.trunc;
    const modifier = tr(numerator * 4096 / denominator);
    return tr((tr(value * modifier) + 2048 - 1) / 4096);
}
```

This is the **pokeRound** formula used in the actual games: `(value × modifier + 2048 - 1) / 4096`, which rounds 0.5 down.

#### RPG-WIP:
Uses simple multiplication with `Math.floor` or `pokeRound`:
```typescript
// Example from battle-core.ts lines 829-834
damage = pokeRound(damage * stabMultiplier);
damage = Math.floor(damage * effectivenessMultiplier);
damage = pokeRound(damage * criticalMultiplier);
damage = Math.floor(damage * randomMultiplier);
damage = pokeRound(damage * spreadMultiplier);
```

**Analysis**: ⚠️ **DIFFERENT IMPLEMENTATION**
- Pokemon-Showdown uses 4096-based modifier arithmetic for precision
- RPG-WIP uses direct multiplication with floor/round functions
- The results may differ slightly in edge cases, particularly with chained modifiers

### 4. Random Factor

#### Pokemon-Showdown:
```typescript
// Location: sim/battle.ts, lines 2354-2357
randomizer(baseDamage: number) {
    const tr = this.trunc;
    return tr(tr(baseDamage * (100 - this.random(16))) / 100);
}
```

This generates a random number from 85-100 (via `100 - random(16)` where random(16) returns 0-15).

#### RPG-WIP:
```typescript
// Location: impulse/chat-plugins/rpg-wip/battle-core.ts, line 798
const randomMultiplier = Math.floor(Math.random() * 16 + 85) / 100;
```

**Analysis**: ✅ **FUNCTIONALLY EQUIVALENT**
- Both generate a multiplier in the range 0.85-1.00
- Pokemon-Showdown: (100 - [0-15]) / 100 = 0.85-1.00
- RPG-WIP: ([0-15] + 85) / 100 = 0.85-1.00

### 5. Modifier Application Order (Gen 9)

#### Pokemon-Showdown Order (in modifyDamage):
1. Add 2 to base damage
2. Spread modifier (0.75 for double battles)
3. Parental Bond modifier
4. Weather modifier
5. Critical hit multiplier
6. Random factor (0.85-1.00)
7. STAB multiplier
8. Type effectiveness
9. Burn modifier (if applicable)
10. Final modifiers (Life Orb, etc.)

#### RPG-WIP Order (in calculateDamage):
1. Add 2 to base damage
2. Metronome item modifier
3. Screen modifiers (Reflect/Light Screen)
4. Weather modifiers
5. Terrain modifiers
6. Ability damage modifiers
7. Item damage modifiers
8. STAB multiplier
9. Type effectiveness (with berry reduction)
10. Critical hit multiplier
11. Random factor
12. Spread multiplier

**Analysis**: ⚠️ **ORDER DIFFERENCES**
- The order of modifier application differs significantly
- In actual games and Pokemon-Showdown, the order matters because rounding occurs after each step
- RPG-WIP applies some modifiers in different positions which can cause small damage differences

### 6. Critical Hit Multiplier

#### Pokemon-Showdown:
```typescript
// Location: sim/battle-actions.ts, line 1749
baseDamage = tr(baseDamage * (move.critModifier || (this.battle.gen >= 6 ? 1.5 : 2)));
```

#### RPG-WIP:
```typescript
// Location: impulse/chat-plugins/rpg-wip/battle-core.ts, line 796-797
const criticalMultiplier = isCritical ? (attackerAbility === 'sniper' ? 2.25 : 1.5) : 1;
damage = pokeRound(damage * criticalMultiplier);
```

**Analysis**: ✅ **MOSTLY ACCURATE**
- Base critical hit multiplier of 1.5x matches Gen 6+ games
- Sniper ability correctly increases to 2.25x (1.5 × 1.5)

### 7. STAB (Same-Type Attack Bonus)

#### Pokemon-Showdown:
Uses complex logic for Tera types and Stellar:
```typescript
// Location: sim/battle-actions.ts, lines 1756-1791
let stab: number | [number, number] = 1;
if (isSTAB) stab = 1.5;
// Stellar type special handling
if (pokemon.terastallized === 'Stellar') {
    stab = isSTAB ? 2 : [4915, 4096];
}
```

#### RPG-WIP:
```typescript
// Location: impulse/chat-plugins/rpg-wip/abilities.ts (via RPGAbilities.getSTABMultiplier)
// Returns 1.5 for STAB, with Adaptability increasing to 2.0
```

**Analysis**: ✅ **ACCURATE FOR BASIC CASES**
- Standard STAB of 1.5x is implemented
- Adaptability 2.0x is implemented
- Tera Stellar handling exists but may differ slightly

### 8. Type Effectiveness

Both implementations correctly calculate type effectiveness:
- Super effective: 2.0x
- Not very effective: 0.5x
- Immune: 0x
- Dual-type stacking is multiplicative

**Analysis**: ✅ **ACCURATE**

### 9. Screen Effects (Reflect/Light Screen)

Both implementations correctly apply 0.5x damage reduction for screens.

**Analysis**: ✅ **ACCURATE**

### 10. 16-bit Truncation

#### Pokemon-Showdown:
Applies 16-bit truncation at the end:
```typescript
// Location: sim/battle-actions.ts, line 1835
return tr(baseDamage, 16);
```

#### RPG-WIP:
Does not explicitly apply 16-bit truncation.

**Analysis**: ❌ **MISSING** (Low Impact)
- 16-bit truncation prevents integer overflow when damage values exceed the maximum 16-bit unsigned integer value (65535)
- This is primarily relevant for extremely high-damage scenarios that rarely occur in normal gameplay
- May cause differences when calculated damage exceeds 65535, though this is virtually impossible under normal game conditions

## Summary Table

| Feature | Pokemon-Showdown | RPG-WIP | Accuracy |
|---------|------------------|---------|----------|
| Base Formula | Correct | Correct | ✅ |
| Truncation Method | `>>> 0` bitwise | `Math.floor` | ✅ |
| Modifier Precision | 4096-based | Direct multiply | ⚠️ |
| Random Factor | 85-100 range | 85-100 range | ✅ |
| Critical Hit | 1.5x (Gen 6+) | 1.5x | ✅ |
| STAB | 1.5x | 1.5x | ✅ |
| Type Effectiveness | Correct | Correct | ✅ |
| Modifier Order | Official Order | Custom Order | ⚠️ |
| 16-bit Truncation | Yes | No | ❌ |

## Recommendations

1. **Optional Enhancement**: Consider implementing the 4096-based modifier system for better accuracy with chained modifiers. However, this is only necessary for competitive accuracy.

2. **Optional Enhancement**: Review modifier application order to match the official games more closely. The current order works but may produce slightly different results.

3. **Low Priority**: Add 16-bit truncation at the final step for edge case handling (extremely high damage values).

4. **Not Required**: The current implementation is functionally accurate for most normal gameplay scenarios. The differences would only be noticeable in edge cases with multiple stacking modifiers or extremely high damage values.

## Detailed Implementation Comparison

### RPG-WIP Modifier Application Order (battle-core.ts lines 824-834):
1. Screen modifiers (Reflect/Light Screen/Aurora Veil) - via `applyFinalDamageModifiers`
2. Weather modifiers (Sun/Rain) - via `applyFinalDamageModifiers`
3. Terrain modifiers - via `applyFinalDamageModifiers`
4. Mud Sport/Water Sport - via `applyFinalDamageModifiers`
5. Ability damage modifiers - via `applyFinalDamageModifiers`
6. Item damage modifiers (Life Orb, type boosters) - via `applyFinalDamageModifiers`
7. STAB multiplier - `damage = pokeRound(damage * stabMultiplier)`
8. Type effectiveness - `damage = Math.floor(damage * effectivenessMultiplier)`
9. Critical hit - `damage = pokeRound(damage * criticalMultiplier)`
10. Random factor - `damage = Math.floor(damage * randomMultiplier)`
11. Spread damage - `damage = pokeRound(damage * spreadMultiplier)`

### Pokemon-Showdown Modifier Application Order (battle-actions.ts):
1. +2 to base damage
2. Spread modifier (doubles battles)
3. Parental Bond modifier
4. Weather modifier (via event)
5. Critical hit multiplier
6. Random factor (85-100%)
7. STAB multiplier
8. Type effectiveness
9. Burn modifier
10. Final modifiers (Life Orb, etc. via ModifyDamage event)
11. 16-bit truncation

## Conclusion

The rpg-wip battle simulator's damage formula is **fundamentally accurate** and follows the correct Gen 9 damage calculation formula. The main differences are implementation details:

1. **Modifier precision**: Using direct multiplication instead of 4096-based arithmetic may cause 1-2 point differences in rare cases
2. **Modifier order**: Slightly different application order may cause minor variations
3. **16-bit overflow**: Missing truncation only affects extreme edge cases

**For a single-player RPG experience, these differences are negligible and the simulator provides an authentic Pokémon battle experience.** The implementation correctly handles:

- All 18 types and their effectiveness chart
- Abilities that modify damage (Pure Power, Huge Power, Filter, etc.)
- Weather effects on Fire/Water moves
- Terrain effects on grounded Pokémon
- Screen damage reduction (Reflect, Light Screen, Aurora Veil)
- STAB with Adaptability support
- Critical hits with proper multipliers
- Random damage factor (85-100%)
- All major held items (Life Orb, Choice items, type boosters, etc.)

The rpg-wip simulator is well-suited for its purpose and provides accurate battle mechanics for a Pokémon RPG experience.
