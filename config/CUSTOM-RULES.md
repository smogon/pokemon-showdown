Custom Rules
============

Pokémon Showdown supports custom rules in three ways:

- Challenging another user, using the command `/challenge USERNAME, FORMAT @@@ RULES`

- Tournaments, using the command `/tour rules RULES` (see the [Tournament command help][tour-help])

- Custom formats on your side server, by editing `config/formats.ts`

Bans
----

Bans are just a `-` followed by the thing you want to ban.

### Individual bans

`- Arceus` - ban a Pokémon (including all formes)

`- Arceus-Flying` or `- Giratina-Altered` - ban a specific Pokémon forme

`- Giratina-Base` - ban only the base forme of a Pokémon (this always works, in case you forget it's called `- Giratina-Altered`)

`- Baton Pass` - ban a move

`- move: Metronome` - ban a move with an ambiguous name

`- Bright Powder` - ban an item

`- item: Metronome` - ban an item with an ambiguous name

### Group bans

`- OU` or `- DUU` - ban a tier

`- CAP` or `- Mega` - ban a pokemon category

`- LGPE` - ban things only available Let's Ge Pikachu/Eevee

`- Past` - ban things that only appear in a past generation (such as Berserk Gene in Gen 5, spiky-eared Pichu in Gen 5, or Unown in Gen 8)

`- Future` - ban things that only appears in a future generation (such as Arceus in Gen 1)

`- Custom` - ban made-up things other than CAP (such as Magikarp's Revenge, or Staff Bros moves)

`- Nonexistent` - catch-all to ban all nonexistent Pokémon, items, etc. Includes: `- CAP, - Past, - Future, - LGPE`

`- Unobtainable` - ban all things designed never to be released (Pokestars in Gen 5, Eternatus-E, Floette-E)

`- Unreleased` - ban all things that will probably be released eventually (Venusaur in Gen 8)

`- Mythical` - ban all Mythical Pokémon (such as Mew, Celebi)

`- Restricted Legendary` - ban all Restricted Legendary Pokémon (such as Zekrom, Eternatus)

`- all items` - ban all items

`- no item` - force every pokemon to hold an item (ban empty item slots)

`- all abilities, + No Ability` - ban all abilities (No Ability needs to be specifically allowed to allow Pokemon with no abilities)

### Complex bans

`- Blaziken + Speed Boost` - ban a combination of things in a single Pokemon (you can have a Blaziken, and you can have Speed Boost on the same team, but the Blaziken can't have Speed Boost)

`- Drizzle ++ Swift Swim` - ban a combination of things in a team (if any Pokémon on your team have Drizzle, no Pokémon can have Swift Swim)


Unbans
------

Unbans are just a `+` followed by the thing you want to unban.

Syntax is identical to bans, just replace `-` with `+`, like:

`+ Blaziken` - unban a Pokémon

`+ Past` - unban all past-generation-only things

More specific always trumps less specific:

`- all pokemon, + Uber, - Giratina, + Giratina-Altered` - allow only Ubers other than Giratina-Origin

`- all pokemon, + Giratina-Altered, - Giratina, + Uber` - allow only Ubers other than Giratina-Origin

`- Nonexistent, + Necturna` - don't allow anything from outside the game, except the CAP Necturna

Except `all pokemon`, which removes all bans/unbans of pokemon before it:

`- all pokemon, + Pikachu, + Raichu` - allow Pikachu and Raichu

`+ Pikachu, - all pokemon, + Raichu` - allow only Raichu

(Note that `all pokemon` does not affect obtainability rules. `+ all pokemon` will not allow CAPs or anything like that.)

For equally specific rules, the last rule wins:

`- Pikachu, - Pikachu, + Pikachu` - allow Pikachu

`+ Pikachu, - Pikachu, + Pikachu, - Pikachu` - ban Pikachu


Restrictions
------------

Some rules act on restricted things, without entirely banning or unbanning them. `*` is used to mark something that is restricted (it will simultaneously be unbanned).

`* Uber, Limit One Restricted` - allow at most one Uber-tiered Pokémon on a team

`* Restricted Legendary, Limit Two Restricted` - allow at most two restricted legendaries on a team

Marking something as restricted with `*` does nothing by itself, you need to combine it with a rule that affects restricted things, such as `Limit One Restricted`.

Other examples include:

- Cross Evolution: Restricting a species prevents it from being the target of a cross evolution. (Ban a species to prevent it from being the base of a cross evolution.)
- Mix and Mega: Restricting a species prevents that Pokémon from holding a mega stone. (Ban a stone to prevent all Pokémon from holding it.)
- Inheritance: Restricting a species prevents it from being inherited from. (Ban a species to prevent it from inheriting from another species.)
- Trademarked: Restricting a move prevents it from being used as a trademark, but the move can still appear in a moveset.

Restriction rules are used to adjust the behaviour of the above metagames. The syntax is identical to bans, just replace `-` with `*`, like:

`* Blaziken` - restrict a Pokémon

`* Uber` - restrict a group of Pokémon

`* Baton Pass` - restrict a move

An unban (`+`) will remove a restriction.


Whitelisting
------------

Instead of a banlist, you can have a list of allowed things:

`- all pokemon, + Charmander, + Squirtle, + Bulbasaur` - allow only Kanto starters

`- all moves, + move: Metronome` - allow only the move Metronome

`- all abilities, + No Ability` - ban all abilities

`- all items, + item: Metronome` - allow only the item Metronome

`- all items, - no item, + item: Metronome` - force all Pokémon to carry the item Metronome (unlike abilities, `- all items` does not include not carrying an item)


Legality rules
--------------

Custom rules can have more complicated behavior. They can also include other rules.

Value rules
-----------

Certain rules can specify a value.

`Max Level = 50` - ban Pokémon above level 50

`Min Level = 10` - ban Pokémon below level 10

`Max Total Level = 200` - only allow Pokémon whose combined levels add up to 200 or below (if combined with `Picked Team Size`, only the picked team needs to be below that combined level)

`Max Team Size = 4` - you must bring a team with at most 4 pokemon (before Team Preview, in games with Team Preview)

`Min Team Size = 4` - you must bring a team with at least 4 pokemon (before Team Preview, in games with Team Preview)

`Picked Team Size = 4` - in Team Preview, you must pick exactly 4 pokemon (if this exists, `Min Team Size` will default to this number)

`Min Source Gen = 7` - only allow pokemon obtained in this generation or later

`Adjust Level = 50` - change all levels to 50, like in some in-game formats (unlike `Max Level`, this still allows moves learned above level 50)

`Adjust Level Down = 50` - change Pokémon with level above 50 to level 50 (but leave Pokémon below 50 alone), like in some in-game formats (unlike `Max Level`, this still allows moves learned above level 50)

`Force Monotype = Water` - require all Pokémon to be Water-type

`EV Limits = Atk 0-100 / Def 50-150` - require EVs to be in those ranges


In-battle rules
---------------

`VGC Timer` - use the VGC timer (90 second Team Preview, 7 minutes Your Time, 1 minute per turn)

`Exact HP Mod` - Show all Pokémon's exact HP and max HP in the battle log

`Switch Priority Clause Mod` - make the fastest Pokémon switch first when more than one Pokémon switches out at once, unlike in Emerald link battles, where Player 1's Pokémon would switch first.


Standard Rulesets
-----------------

Note: Most formats already come with one standard ruleset. Removing and adding multiple standard rulesets in the same tournament is likely to have unintended results.

`Standard` - the standard ruleset for most Smogon singles formats. Includes the Evasion Moves Clause, Sleep Clause Mod, Species Clause, Nickname Clause, OHKO Clause, Endless Battle Clause, HP Percentage Mod, and Cancel Mod.

`Standard NEXT` - the standard ruleset for NEXT. Allows some unreleased Pokémon and includes the Evasion Moves Clause, Nickname Clause, Sleep Clause Mod, Species Clause, OHKO Clause, HP Percentage Mod, and Cancel Mod. Bans Soul Dew.

`Flat Rules` - the standard ruleset for in-game formats, such as Battle Spot. Includes Species Clause, Item Clause, Cancel Mod, Nickname Clause, and Team Preview. Bans mythical Pokémon and restricted legendaries (e.g. Zekrom, Reshiram, Zygarde, Eternatus)

`Standard NatDex` - the standard ruleset for National Dex formats. Allows the National Dex. Includes Nickname Clause, HP Percentage Mod, Cancel Mod, Endless Battle Clause.

`Standard Doubles` - the standard ruleset for most Smogon doubles formats. Includes Species Clause, Nickname Clause, OHKO Clause, Evasion Abilities Clause, Evasion Moves Clause, Endless Battle Clause, HP Percentage Mod, Cancel Mod.


Removing rules
--------------

Put `!` in front of a rule to remove it, like:

`! Team Preview` - do not use Team Preview

You can use this to remove individual parts of rules, like:

`Obtainable, ! Obtainable Moves` - require pokemon to be obtained legitimately, except for moves, which they can use whatever

For value rules, you just put `!` in front of the rule name, no `=`:

`Flat Rules, ! Picked Team Size` - use Flat Rules, but players can pick 6

To prevent mistakes, value rules can't be changed without being removed first. Use `!!` to remove and replace a value rule:

`Flat Rules, !! Picked Team Size = 5` - use Flat Rules, but players can pick 5


Multiple rules
--------------

In case you haven't figured it out from the rest of this page, you combine rules with a `,` (comma).


Tiers and Formats
-----------------

Any format (starting with `Gen [number]`) can be used as a rule, to add all rules from that format.

For example:

`Gen 8 OU` - add all clauses and bans from Gen 8 OU.

`Gen 8 Almost Any Ability` - add all clauses and bans from Gen 8 Almost Any Ability, allowing Pokémon to use almost any ability in the game.

People often use "tier" to mean "format", but in rulesets, the difference is important. A format is a list of rules for a game you can play, such as "Gen 8 OU". A tier is a list of Pokémon which can be banned or unbanned, such as "OU".

`- OU, + Ubers` - ban all Pokémon currently in OU and unban all Pokémon currently in Ubers
